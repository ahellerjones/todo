### Let's start over from reading the docs. 
And it would be pretty good to 
build a simple backend project from start to finish, like 
seriously actually do it. 


Do a simple fucking todo app, 
with user authentication, 
front end, 
backend database based on user ID. 
You can do this, and have to do this. 


Ooo, bindings are inprocess access, not REST APIs. Cool.


Ok, let's just fucking send it. 

1. Make worker reply with request contents :check:
2. Create API for account creation 
    a. Let's make a database. :check: 
3. Create API for login, from then onwards the user will be authenticated by their token. :check: 
    
 


TODO: 
    1. Add auto cleanup of expired sessions 
    2. add POST /logout 
    3. We want a todo app right, so let's do some shit. 
        a. Front end for logging in. 


Rough notes: 
1. When connecting a project to a GitHub repo that hasn't been initialized yet (no main branch), the error is vague about a bad request body. Could be more descriptive.
