### Let's start over from reading the docs. 
And it would be pretty good to 
build a simple backend project from start to finish, like 
seriously actually do it. 


Do a simple fucking todo app, 
with user authentication, 
front end, 
backend database based on user ID. 
You can do this, and have to do this. 


Ooo, bindings are inprocess access, not REST APIs. Cool.


Ok, let's just fucking send it. 

Make a worker endpoint which takes a request with userID and responds with hello userID 


From there, create a user, store it in a db, 
Then make some sort of auth.  
 


Rough notes: 
1. When connecting a project to a GitHub repo that hasn't been initialized yet (no main branch), the error is vague about a bad request body. Could be more descriptive.
